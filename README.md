# 🚀 React Bio Card – Prabhav Jain

Welcome to my mini project — a **dynamic personal bio card** built with React and styled with custom animations, interactive cursor, and a meteor-shower themed background!

## 🎯 Objective

This project is part of the *Fork-n-Build* challenge. The goal was to create something personal and visually engaging using current tech skills — so I built a React-based personal portfolio page with:

- Animated Bio Card  
- Skills popup with icons  
- Project cards with images  
- Contact section with a message form  
- Light/Dark mode toggle  
- Custom cursor and meteor shower animation
